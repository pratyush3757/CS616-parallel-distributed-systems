Coherence: Load always results in a value of last store, irrespective of the isolation level.
Only occures due to cache.
Coherent schedule:
t=19 CPU 1 Store X = 4
t=20 CPU 2 Store X = 5
t=21 CPU 1 Load X (assert X==5)

Non-Coherent schedule:
t=19 CPU 1 Store X = 4
t=20 CPU 2 Store X = 5
t=21 CPU 1 Load X (assert X==4)

Ways to ensure coherence:
- Write Propagation (write-invalidate or write-update)
- Cache invalidation through controllers (Snooping)
